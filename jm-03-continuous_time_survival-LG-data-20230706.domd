# Overview

This document summarizes analyses condicted for 2022 Î¨MCA work group 3, focusing on the effect of blood sugar (HbA1c) in memory performance change over 10 years in Black or African-American participants the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). 

The goal of this analysis was to estimate a joint model (a growth curve model with a survival model) to compare to a model that uses propensity score weighted analyses (Laura Gibbons is conducting those analyses). To build up to the joint model, I estimate: a (1) survival model in Stata to compare to a (2) survival model in Mplus, a (3) growth curve model, and finally a (4) joint model. Unconditional (i.e., no covariates) and conditional (i.e., with covariates) models are analyzed for all but the joint model (only a conditional joint model is estimated). The covariates used in the adjusted or conditional models are all of those factors that Laura used in generating the selection weights. 

Missing data among the covariates were handled with multiple imputation. Laura Gibbons performed the imputation and provided the analytic data set. All analyses in this report report results based on 5 imputations. The descriptive table uses the non-imputed data.

This analysis uses HRS data, but does not use sampling weights.

## Summary of findings

HbA1c (the spline version) is significantly related to risk of death (HR 1.12 [1.05, 1.19] per unit difference in HbA1c spline) in the unconditional model and this effect is attenuated (HR 1.07) when controlling for covariates but remains significant, including in the joint model. 

HbA1c spline is not significantly related to *level* (i.e., intercept) and *slope* (change over 10 years follow-up) in memory performance, and this is true in the unconditional, conditional, and joint model. The point estimate suggests lower memory performance with higher HbA1c, and faster (i.e., more negative) slope with higher HbA1c, but we cannot rule out that the true effect is no effect given the sample size (confidence intervals include 0). The effect of HbA1c in intercept is relatively unchanged between the unconditional, conditional, and joint model. The effect of HbA1c in slope is about a half of the magnitude in the unconditional and joint models relative to the unconditional model. 

The conditional and joint models are not appreciably different. Therefore, conditioning the growth model on survival did not influence how we assess the relationship between HbA1c and memory performance and change.

Finally, the Cox model estimated with Stata and the continuous time survival model estimated with Mplus produce slightly different parameter estimates. I don't have an explanation for that, and therefore all of the results are somewhat tenuous.
